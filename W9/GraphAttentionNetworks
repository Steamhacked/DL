Steps to GAN:
  1) Linear transformation of all features h_i of each node x_i, by multiplying with weight matrix W (R^(F'xF)) F-> number of nodes features in h_i, 
F'-> number of features expected at the end of the embedding
  2) Using shared attentional mechanism: e_i,j = a(Wh_i, Wh_j); replace a with feedforward network, with a = R^2F' (matrix) and LeakyReLU activation
  3) Normalize coefficients a_i,j with softmax
  4) Propagation rule: h_i' = sigma(SIGMA_j nbrs(i) {a_i,j * Wh_j}) 
  5) Optional: Use K>1 heads for attention mechanism (aggregation mechanism)
