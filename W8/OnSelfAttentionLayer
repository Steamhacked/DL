Q -> W_q*x -> Information in another word that will make sense
K -> W_k*x -> Information provided by the word
V -> W_v*x -> What exactly should be transferred when found



x_i -> initial word embedding
q_i -> representation of what information will be useful for x_i
k_j -> representation of what information is provided by x_j

if q & k match -> greater value = greater correlation/interdependence, if not -> disregard (meaningless connection)
