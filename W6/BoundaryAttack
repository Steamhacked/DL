BlackBox type of attack,

  Iteratively noise x_i, until ||x^~-x|| -> minimized (maximized plausibility) (Walk along the boundary):
    x_0 noised -> misclassified
    noise x_0 & check if ||x_1-x|| < ||x_n-x|| keep x_1, otherwise x_1=x_0
    

  Takes a lot of iterations, computationally intensive & slow

More sophisticated: attempt to visualize/predict shape of a boundary
