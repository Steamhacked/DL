Mechanisms of Defends: 
  Arms Race
  Defensive Distillation
  Black-Boxing

Advanced Attacks:
  Carlini-Wagner -> targeted, iterated, whitebox
  Surrogate -> any combination
  Boundary -> targeted, iterated, blackbox

Arms Race -> most basoc strategy, assumes anticipation of future attacks; Similar to a data augmentation, retrains & makes model more robust;
  Model is trained to recognized attacks
  Assumes proper assumption, trained against specific attack, (might be not robust enough, attackers get creative)

Defensive Distillation -> Scorched Earth Your own Land -> Destroying your own gradients enough to prevent usage of said gradients to attack, comes with a risk
  Utilizes SoftMax with Temperature: y_i = exp(x_i/T)/Sigma(exp(x_j/T))
  When T->0, largest x_i becomes y_i = 1; everything else tends to 0
  SoftMax -> Retains Order of Magnitude

  When T->inf, y_i->1/N, gradients will vanish
  Vanishing your own gradients will prevent attackers from using them, however training might get more complicated

  Train first with low temperature, set temperature higher after training 

  FGSM still manages to get through it (though not as easily?)
  Carlini-Wagner attack bypasses Defensive Distillation



BlackBoxing -> hide model parameters, to prevent attackers from access and use of those parameters (Last Resort, as of now)
  Surrogate Attack -> recreates a copy of a target model & utilizes parameters of the copy, bypasses blackboxing if copy is recreated correctly

Ensembling -> use of multiple models to prevent attackers from forcing your model to misclassify (majority vote by models)
  (Caveat: models aiming to do the same task, will likely be ~equally weak to the same attack)
