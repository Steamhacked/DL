Rather than utilizing gradients, utilizes logits, bypasses distillation & arms race defense. Uses model's properties to create adversarial dataset


Objective Function? 

x^~ = min_u(f(u))

Unconstrained Multi-Objective Optimization:

min_u ( ||u-x||_2 + alpha * max(d(u), 0)) -> penalizes images u far from og image (plausibility)

with d(u) = max_t!=c^~ (f_t(u)-f_c^~(u)) -> non-zero if image does not have target label (efficacy)

to find most plausible & efficient adversarial sample
