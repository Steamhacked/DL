Time Series Dataset - a sequence of points that are collected over time, typically at regular intervals

Decomposition - separates time series into trend, seasonal and residual subsets

Recurrent Neural Network - NN that operates on series and will:
  Receive an input: observaation at time, memory vectore, computed as one of the NN outputs at time t-1
  Com[ute prediction for observation at time+1, keeping memory of previous operations

Good Memory length:
  Depends on time scale
  Requires optimal complexity (too large memory ->over/underfitting)


RNN - prone to vanishing gradient

History loses potentially useful older information over time

Backpropagation Through Time ->
